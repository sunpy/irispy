Welcome to the IRISpy User Guide. IRISpy is a SunPy-affiliated
package designed for reading, manipulating and visualizing data taken
with the Interface Region Imaging Spectrometer (IRIS).

.. warning::

    IRISPy is still under heavy development and has not yet seen its first
    release.  The API can change at any time and so should not be
    relied upon.  However, we are striving towards releasing a stable
    version.  If you would like to help by providing user feedback,
    reporting bugs, or contributing code, install the development
    version as outlined in :ref:`dev_install`.
